======= BattleShips ==========

Created: September 2016

Status: Complete

We just started learning the basics of Java (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism) and I decided to put what I learnt into practice by re-designing the classical battleship board game (I got stuck halfway through and decided to first do a Tic Tac Toe game as a stepping stone to this project. See Profile for the Tic Tac Toe game). Enjoy!


==== Possible Improvements to project: ====

Different game modes

Implement Exception Handling 

Play using a GUI

create a AI to play against
